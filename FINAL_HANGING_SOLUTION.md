# FINAL SOLUTION: SadTalker Subprocess Hanging Issue

## Problem
The SadTalker backend was hanging when called from subprocess. Specifically:
- The batch file execution would hang indefinitely when called from Python's `subprocess.run()`
- Even with `--no-interrupt` and `--silent` flags, the process would not complete
- Manual execution worked fine, but automated execution failed

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **Batch File Environment Activation**: The batch file was trying to activate a virtual environment with `call sadtalker_env\Scripts\activate.bat`, which can hang in subprocess execution
2. **Subprocess Shell Interaction**: Windows batch files don't play well with Python subprocess when they contain interactive elements or environment changes

## Solution
### 1. Bypass Batch File Completely
Instead of calling the batch file from subprocess, call the Python inference script directly:

```python
# OLD (hanging approach)
sadtalker_cmd = [SADTALKER_BATCH_FILE, "--driven_audio", audio_path, ...]

# NEW (working approach)  
sadtalker_cmd = [
    "python",
    os.path.join(SADTALKER_ROOT_DIR, "inference_enhanced_with_video.py"),
    "--driven_audio", audio_path,
    "--source_image", source_image_path,
    "--result_dir", result_dir,
    "--enhancer", "gfpgan",
    "--preprocess", "full", 
    "--still",
    "--no-interrupt",
    "--silent",
    "--force-local-models"
]
```

### 2. Remove Environment Activation
Updated batch files to skip virtual environment activation:

```batch
REM Skip environment activation for non-interactive mode
echo Skipping virtual environment activation for non-interactive execution
echo Using system Python for reliable background operation
```

### 3. Add Proper Timeout Handling
Added comprehensive timeout and error handling:

```python
start_time = time.time()
try:
    process = subprocess.run(
        sadtalker_cmd,
        cwd=SADTALKER_ROOT_DIR,
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
        check=False,
        timeout=120  # 2 minute timeout
    )
    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
    logging.info(f"Subprocess completed in {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
    logging.error(f"Process timed out after {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")
    raise RuntimeError("SadTalker process timed out")
```

## Files Modified
1. `Website/backend/talking_head/generate_video.py` - Main fix: direct Python call instead of batch file
2. `SadTalker/run_sadtalker_no_download.bat` - Removed environment activation  
3. `Website/run_sadtalker_enhanced.bat` - Removed environment activation
4. `Website/test_simple_execution.py` - Test script to verify the fix

## Testing
The fix was verified with:
```bash
python test_simple_execution.py
```

## Result
✅ SadTalker now executes properly from subprocess without hanging
✅ Timeout protection prevents indefinite hanging
✅ Proper error handling and logging
✅ Backend integration works reliably
