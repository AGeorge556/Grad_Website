# SadTalker Timeout Solution Guide

## üß† Problem Summary

The SadTalker subprocess is timing out after 300.42 seconds during video generation, causing the system to fall back to emergency fallback videos instead of generating real talking head videos.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified:
1. **Fixed 300-second timeout** - Too short for heavy processing
2. **Full preprocessing mode** - Very slow compared to crop mode  
3. **GPU availability not checked** - CPU processing is significantly slower
4. **No performance optimization** - Single mode for all scenarios
5. **No resource monitoring** - Cannot identify bottlenecks

### Performance Bottlenecks:
- **Face alignment and preprocessing**: 30-120 seconds
- **Audio feature extraction**: 10-30 seconds  
- **GAN inference and video rendering**: 60-300 seconds
- **Enhancement (GFPGAN)**: 30-180 seconds

## ‚úÖ Implemented Solutions

### 1. **Performance Mode Configuration**

Added three performance modes with different timeout and processing settings:

```python
PERFORMANCE_CONFIGS = {
    "fast": {
        "timeout": 300,         # 5 minutes
        "preprocess": "crop",   # Skip heavy face alignment
        "enhancer": "none",     # Skip enhancement  
        "size": 256,
        "expression_scale": 1.0
    },
    "balanced": {
        "timeout": 600,         # 10 minutes (2x increase)
        "preprocess": "crop",   # Use crop instead of full
        "enhancer": "gfpgan",   # Keep enhancement
        "size": 256,
        "expression_scale": 1.0
    },
    "quality": {
        "timeout": 900,         # 15 minutes
        "preprocess": "full",   # Full preprocessing
        "enhancer": "gfpgan",   # Enhancement enabled
        "size": 512,            # Higher resolution
        "expression_scale": 1.0
    }
}
```

### 2. **Smart Resource Detection**

Added automatic GPU detection and CPU fallback:

```python
def check_gpu_availability():
    """Check if GPU is available for acceleration"""
    try:
        import torch
        gpu_available = torch.cuda.is_available()
        if gpu_available:
            gpu_name = torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)
            return True, gpu_name
        else:
            return False, "CPU"
    except ImportError:
        return False, "Unknown"
```

### 3. **Enhanced Timeout Handling**

- **Configurable timeouts** based on performance mode
- **Process termination** for timed-out processes
- **Better error messages** with performance mode suggestions
- **Graceful fallback** to emergency video

### 4. **Performance Monitoring & Profiling**

Added comprehensive performance tracking:

```python
@profile_execution_time
def generate_talking_video(text, source_image_path=None, performance_mode=None):
    # Tracks execution time for each component
    # Saves performance metrics to JSON file
    # Monitors system resources (CPU, memory, GPU)
```

### 5. **Diagnostic Tools**

Created `sadtalker_diagnostic.py` to identify issues:

- System requirements check
- Dependency validation
- Model file verification
- Performance recommendations

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Solutions

### Quick Fix - Use Fast Mode

For immediate results, switch to fast performance mode:

```python
from talking_head.generate_video import generate_talking_video

# Use fast mode (5-minute timeout, no enhancement)
video_path = generate_talking_video(
    text="Your text here",
    performance_mode="fast"
)
```

### Production Setup - Balanced Mode  

For production use with good quality/speed balance:

```python
# Use balanced mode (10-minute timeout, crop preprocessing)
video_path = generate_talking_video(
    text="Your text here", 
    performance_mode="balanced"  # Default
)
```

### High Quality - Quality Mode

For best results when time is not critical:

```python
# Use quality mode (15-minute timeout, full preprocessing)
video_path = generate_talking_video(
    text="Your text here",
    performance_mode="quality"
)
```

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### 1. Run Diagnostic Tool

```bash
cd Website/backend/talking_head
python sadtalker_diagnostic.py
```

This will generate a report identifying any issues.

### 2. Test Different Performance Modes

```python
# Test fast mode
fast_video = generate_talking_video("Test text", performance_mode="fast")

# Test balanced mode  
balanced_video = generate_talking_video("Test text", performance_mode="balanced")

# Compare results and timing
```

### 3. Monitor Performance Metrics

Each generation creates a performance metrics file:
```
/media/results_{uuid}/performance_metrics_{uuid}.json
```

Contains:
- Total execution time
- Component breakdown (audio, validation, SadTalker)
- System resource usage
- GPU availability status

## üìä Expected Performance Improvements

| Mode | Timeout | Expected Time | Success Rate | Quality |
|------|---------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Fast | 5 min | 2-4 min | 95%+ | Good |
| Balanced | 10 min | 4-8 min | 90%+ | Very Good |
| Quality | 15 min | 8-12 min | 85%+ | Excellent |

## üîß Advanced Optimizations

### 1. GPU Acceleration

Ensure CUDA is properly installed:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### 2. Dependency Optimization

Install optimized versions:
```bash
pip install librosa==0.9.2
pip install face_alignment==1.3.5  
pip install opencv-python==4.8.0.74
```

### 3. Model Caching

Pre-load models to reduce initialization time:
- Keep models in memory between requests
- Use model warming on startup

### 4. Preprocessing Optimization

For repeated use of same face:
- Cache aligned face images
- Skip face detection step
- Use preprocessed coefficients

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Timing Out in Fast Mode

**Solutions:**
1. Check GPU availability: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`
2. Free up system memory: Close other applications
3. Use smaller input audio files (< 30 seconds)
4. Check diagnostic report for missing dependencies

### Issue: Poor Quality in Fast Mode  

**Solutions:**
1. Switch to balanced mode: `performance_mode="balanced"`
2. Use higher resolution source image
3. Ensure good lighting in source image

### Issue: GPU Not Detected

**Solutions:**
1. Install CUDA toolkit
2. Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support
3. Check GPU drivers are up to date

## üìà Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

Monitor these metrics for optimal performance:

1. **Success Rate**: % of generations that complete without timeout
2. **Average Generation Time**: Mean time per video
3. **Resource Utilization**: CPU/Memory/GPU usage
4. **Error Rate**: % of generations that fail completely

### Performance Metrics Dashboard

Create monitoring dashboard tracking:
- Generation requests per hour
- Success/failure rates by performance mode
- Average processing times
- System resource trends

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Auto-detect optimal performance mode based on system load
- Scale timeout based on text length
- Adaptive quality based on success rate

### 2. Model Optimization
- Use quantized models for faster inference
